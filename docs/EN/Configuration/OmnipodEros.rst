Omnipod Eros
***********************************************************

Safety first
===========================================================
This software is part of a DIY artificial pancreas solution and is not a product but requires YOU to read, learn, and understand the system, including how to use it. You alone are responsible for what you do with it.

Do not attempt this process in an environment where you cannot recover from an error (extra pods, insulin, charged RileyLink, and phone devices are must-haves).

See also `general safety first page <../Getting-Started/Safety-first.html>`_!

Hardware and Software Requirements
===========================================================
At present two different Omnipod models are available:

a. `Omnipod Eros <https://www.omnipod.com/en-gb/about/how-to-use>`_ - launched in 2013 - called 'omnipod system' by manufacturer
b. `Omnipod Dash <https://www.omnipod.com/en-gb/about-dash>`_ - launched in 2019 - PDM looks like a phone-type device

**Only Omnipod Eros can be used with AndroidAPS!**

What you will need
---------------------------------------------------------
* Insulin Delivery Device: a fresh Omnipod (`Eros <https://www.omnipod.com/en-gb/about/how-to-use>`_ generation - NOT DASH) pod
* `Mobile Phone Device <..\Module\module.html#phone>`_: Supported Omnipod driver Android phone with a version of AAPS 2.7.1 (or newer) and related components setup
* Pod Communication Device: a 433MHz RileyLink from `getrileylink.org <getrileylink.org>`_, which is the bridge to communicate with Eros generation pods.

   Other hardware options are available.
   
   * RileyLink with modified Balun Antenna - Untested
   * `Emalink <https://github.com/sks01/EmaLink>`_ - Untested
   * `LoopLink <https://jameswedding.substack.com/>`_ - Untested
   
These instructions will assume that you are **starting a new pod session**. If this is not the case, please be patient and attempt to begin this process on your next pod change.

   * Note: An AAPS notification will ALWAYS be issued for any alert after the initial communication with the pod since the alert was triggered. 
   * Dismissing the notification will NOT dismiss the alert UNLESS automatically acknowledge Pod alerts is enabled.
   * To MANUALLY dismiss the alert you must visit the Omnipod (POD) tab and press the ACK ALERTS button.

* Expiration reminder: Pod expiration reminder set to trigger when the defined number of hours before shutdown is reached.
* Hours before shutdown: Defines the number hours before the active pod shutdown occurs, which will then trigger the expiration reminder alert.
* Low reservoir alert: Alert when the pod remaining units low reservoir limit is reached as defined in the number of units field.
* Number of units: The number of units at which to trigger the pod low reservoir alert.
* Automatically acknowledge Pod alerts: 

   * When enabled a notification will still be issued.
   * However immediately after the first pod communication contact since the alert was issued it will now be automatically acknowledged and the alert will be dismissed.

Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Provides AAPS and phone sound uncertainty notifications.
* Sound for uncertain TBR notifications: Trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPs is uncertain if a TBR was successfully set.
* Sound for uncertain SMB notifications: Trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPS is uncertain if an SMB was successfully delivered.
* Sound for uncertain bolus notifications: Trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPS is uncertain if a bolus was successfully delivered.

Other

* Provides advanced settings to assist debugging.
* Suspend delivery button: Hide or display the suspend delivery button in the Omnipod (POD) tab.
* Pulse log button: Hide or display the pulse log button in the Omnipod (POD) tab.
* DST/Time zone detect on: Allows for time zone changes to be automatically detected if the phone is used in an area where DST is observed.

Activating & deactivating a pod
===========================================================
Activating a pod
---------------------------------------------------------
Before you are able to activate a pod please ensure you have properly configured and connected your RileyLink connection in the `Omnipod settings  <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#identify-riley-link>`_.

REMINDER: **Pod communication occurs at limited ranges for both pod activation and deactivation due to security safety measures.**  During these procedures make sure that your pod is within a close proximity (~50cm or less) to the RileyLink.

* Click on the Pod Mgmt button [1]
* Then click on Activate Pod [2]
* You will see the Fill Pod screen be displayed.  Fill a pod with at least 85U of insulin and listen for two beeps indicating that the pod is ready to be primed.
* Ensure that pod and RileyLink are within close proximity of each other and click on the Next button [3].

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Activate1.png
     :alt: Omnipod pod activation I
  
* The Initialize Pod screen will begin priming the pod (you will hear a click followed by a series of ticking sounds as the pod primes itself). 
* You will see a green checkmark, and the Next button [1] will become enabled upon successful priming.
* Click on the Next button [1], and you will see the Attach Pod screen displayed. 
* Proceed to prepare the infusion site, remove the pod's needle cap and white paper backing from the adhesive and apply the pod to your usually selected site. 
* Click on the Next button [2].
* The Attach Pod dialog box will now appear. 
* ONLY click on the OK button [3] if you are ready to deploy the cannula.

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Activate2.png
     :alt: Omnipod pod activation II

* After pressing OK, it may take some time before the Omnipod responds and inserts the cannula (1-2 minutes maximum), so **be patient**.
* If  RileyLink is out of range of the pod being activated, you will receive an error message “No response from Pod”.
* If this occurs, move the RileyLink closer to (~50 cm away or less) but not on top of the Pod and click the Retry button [1].
* A green checkmark will appear, and the Next button will become enabled upon successful cannula insertion. 
* Click on the Next button [2].

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Activate3.png

Deactivating a pod
---------------------------------------------------------
REMINDER: **Pod communication occurs at limited ranges for both pod activation and deactivation due to security safety measures.**  During these procedures make sure that your pod is within a close proximity (~50cm or less) to the RileyLink.

Under normal circumstances, you should be able to get three days (72 hours) and an additional 8 hours after the pod expiration warning for a total of 80 hours of pod usage.

* To deactivate a pod (either from expiration or from a pod failure) open Omnipod (POD) tab or menu.
* Click on the Pod Mgmt button [1]
* Click on the Deactivate Pod button [2]
* Keep pod close to RileyLink and click Next button [3] to begin the process of deactivating the pod.

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Deactivate1.png
     :alt: Omnipod pod deactivation I
     
* Deactivating Pod screen will appear and you will receive a confirmation beep from the pod that deactivation was successful.
* IF deactivation fails and you do not receive a confirmation beep, you may receive a red “No response from Pod message”. 
* Please click on the Retry button [1] to attempt deactivation again.

Suspending Insulin Delivery
---------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you do not see a SUSPEND button , then it has not been enabled to be displayed in the Omnipod (POD) tab.  Enable the Suspend delivery button enabled setting in the Omnipod settings under `Other <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#other>`_.

Use this command to put the active pod into a suspend state. In this suspend state, the pod will no longer deliver any insulin. This command mimics the suspend function that the original Omnipod PDM issues to an active pod.

* Open Omnipod (POD) tab or menu
* Click on the SUSPEND button [1]
* Suspend command is sent from the RileyLink to the active pod.
* The suspend button will become greyed out [2] and the Pod status will display SUSPEND DELIVERY [3].

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Suspend1.png
     :alt: Omnipod suspend insulin delivery  I

* When the suspend command is successfully confirmed by the RileyLink a confirmation dialog will appear.
* Click OK [1] to confirm and proceed.
* Your active pod has now suspended all insulin delivery. 
* The Omnipod (POD) tab will update the Pod status to 'Suspended' [2].
* The SUSPEND button [3] will change to a new Resume Delivery button.

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Suspend2.png
     :alt: Omnipod suspend insulin delivery  II

Resuming Insulin Delivery
---------------------------------------------------------
Use this command to instruct the active pod to resume insulin delivery. After the command is successfully processed, insulin will resume normal delivery using the current basal rate for the current time from the active basal profile. The pod will again accept commands for bolus, TBR and SMB.  

* Open Omnipod (POD) tab or menu
* Press the Resume Delivery button [1] to start the process to instruct the current pod to resume normal insulin delivery. 
* A message RESUME DELIVERY [2] will display in the Pod status field, signifying the RileyLink is actively sending the command to the suspended pod.
* When the Resume delivery command is successfully confirmed by the RileyLink a confirmation dialog will appear.
* Click OK [3] to confirm and proceed.
* The Omnipod (POD) tab will update the Pod status field to 'Running' [4].
* The Resume Delivery button will now display the SUSPEND button [5].

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_Resume.png
     :alt: Omnipod resume insulin delivery

Acknowledging Pod Alerts
---------------------------------------------------------
NOTE - if you do not see a ACK ALERTS button, it is because it is conditionally displayed on the Omnipod (POD) tab ONLY when the pod expiration or low reservoir alert has been triggered.

The process below will show you how to manually disable pod beeps that occur when the pod time reaches the defined warning limit in the `'Hours before shutdown' <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#alerts>`_ Omnipod alerts setting before the 72 hour (3 days) pod expiration.

NOTE - If you have enabled the Automatically acknowledge Pod alerts setting in `Omnipod Alerts <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#alerts>`_, this alert will be handled automatically after the first occurence and you will NOT need to manually disable the alert. 

* When the defined `'Hours before shutdown' <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#alerts>`_ limit is reached, the pod will issue warning beeps to inform you that it is approaching its expiration time and a pod change will soon be required. 
* You can verify this on the Omnipod (POD) tab under the 'Active Pod alerts' [1] field where the status message 'Pod will expire soon' is displayed.
* Press the ACK ALERTS button (acknowledge alerts) [2].
* The RileyLink sends the command to deactivate pod expiration warning beeps to the pod and updates the Pod status field with ACKNOWLEDGE ALERTS [3].
* Upon successful deactivation of the alerts two beeps will be issued by the active pod and a confirmation dialog will be displayed.
* Click OK [4] to confirm and dismiss the dialog.
* On the Omnipod (POD) tab the warning message under the Active Pod alerts will no longer be displayed [5] and the active pod will no longer issue pod expiration warning beeps.

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_AcknowledgeAlert.png
     :alt: Acknowledge Alert

Troubleshooting Omnipod
===========================================================
Pump Unreachable Alerts
---------------------------------------------------------
* It is recommended that pump unreachable alerts be configured to 120 minutes.

   * Three-dot menu on top right-hand side
   * Preferences
   * Local Alerts
   * Pump unreachable threshold [min]: 120
   
Pod Failures
---------------------------------------------------------
* Pods fail occasionally due to a variety of issues, including hardware issues with the Pod itself.
* It is best practice not to call these into Insulet, since AAPS is not an approved use case.
* A list of fault codes is available on this site `<https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Fault-event-codes>`_ to help determine the cause.

Import Settings
---------------------------------------------------------
* Please note that importing settings may import possibly outdated Pod status. As a result, you may lose any active Pod.
* It is therefore strongly recommended that you **do not import settings while on an active Pod session**.

   * Deactivate your pod session. Verify that you do not have an active pod session.
   * Export your settings and store a copy in a safe place.
   * Uninstall the previous version of AAPS and restart your phone.
   * Install new version of AAPS and verify that you have no active pod session prior to attempting to import your settings.
   * For details instructions on exporting and importing sessions see `this page <../Usage/ExportImportSettings.html>`_.

Omnipod driver alerts
---------------------------------------------------------
Please note that the Omnipod driver presents a variety of unique alerts on the Overview tab, most of them are informational and can be dismissed while some provide the user with an action to take to resolve the cause of the triggered alert.

A summary of the main alerts that you may encounter is listed below:
* 'No active Pod' - No active Pod session detected.  You may select SNOOZE on this alert which will remain or trigger again until a `Pod session is started <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#activating-a-pod>`_.
* 'Pod suspended' - Informational alert that Pod has been `suspended <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#suspending-insulin-delivery>`_.
* 'Setting basal profile failed. Delivery might be suspended! Please manually refresh the Pod status from the Omnipod tab and resume delivery if needed.' - Informational alert that the Pod basal profile setting has failed and you will need to hit Refresh on the `Omnipod tab <../Configuration/OmnipodEros.html#omnipod-tab>`_.

Best practice
===========================================================
Optimal Omnipod and RileyLink Positioning
---------------------------------------------------------
* For security reasons positioning of RileyLink and pod is crucial during activation and deactivation of pod.
* This includes the distance between the two as well as the orientation of RileyLink's antenna.
* The pod MUST not be set directly on top of the RileyLink - due to the way the RileyLink's antenna radiates the signal.
* Both should be less than 50 cm apart - see picture.

   .. image:: ../images/Omnipod_RLDistance.png
     :alt: Positioning of RileyLink and pod

* A wider range can be used for normal operations once pod has been activated.
